# OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T Star Wars theme activator

There is a hidden Star Wars theme inside of OxygenOS, bringing in a red accent. It is supposed to be exclusively available for the OnePlus 5T Star Wars edition device; however, custom kernels can add back the sysfs path to enable it with [this commit](https://github.com/nathanchance/op5/commit/6251bfe60d1ea7d46bc70889b73b40020a25645c). This module will do literally nothing without that commit.

To use it, zip it up then flash it!

```bash
zip -r9 oneplus5-oos-starwars-theme.zip -x README.md -- *
```
